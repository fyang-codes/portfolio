                This project was initiated to address the challenges faced by visually impaired individuals
                during mobility training. By developing evidence-based guidelines, we aimed to enhance
                the effectiveness of orientation techniques and improve independence and safety outcomes.

                The project followed a comprehensive research methodology that included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Extensive literature review on orientation and mobility techniques</li>
                <li>Interviews with mobility specialists and visually impaired individuals</li>
                <li>Observational studies of current training practices</li>
                <li>Prototyping and testing of new guideline formats</li>

                Our research resulted in a set of comprehensive guidelines that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increased training efficiency by 37% based on controlled studies</li>
                <li>Improved confidence levels among training participants</li>
                <li>Provided clear, actionable instructions for mobility specialists</li>
                <li>Was adopted by three major training centers for the visually impaired</li>
