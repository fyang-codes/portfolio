    <h1>Building AI That Actually Cares About Gender Equality</h1>
    <p><em>Women in AI Hackathon Finalist | November - December 2023 | Ontario (Online)</em></p>

    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes the best projects come from the most obvious questions: "Why are there so few women in government, and can AI help us understand why?" Turns out, this question led to a month-long deep dive into politics, data science, and building something that might actually make a difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a hackathon focused on ethical AI, our team decided to tackle one of democracy's most persistent problems - the underrepresentation of women in legislative bodies worldwide. We had one month to not just identify the problem, but build an AI solution that could help people understand and address it.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Built - LegisLadies.com</h2>
    <p>
      We created a dual-purpose platform that was part detective, part educator. The heart of it was a causal factor analyzer - basically, we taught an AI to look at economic, cultural, and political data from different countries and figure out what actually keeps women out of parliament (spoiler: it's complicated).
    </p>
    <p>
      But data without context is just numbers, so we paired our regression models with a chatbot that could have real conversations about the findings. Imagine asking "Why does Sweden have 47% women in parliament while some countries have less than 5%?" and getting an AI response that breaks down the contributing factors in plain English.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Causal factor analyzer using machine learning regression models</li>
      <li>Interactive data visualization dashboard for country comparisons</li>
      <li>Conversational AI chatbot for explaining complex political factors</li>
      <li>Educational resources for schools and advocacy organizations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Technical Journey</h2>
    <p>
      The debugging sessions were intense. Building a regression model that could handle the messy, incomplete nature of global political data meant countless late nights tweaking algorithms in Python. We had to account for everything from electoral systems to cultural attitudes to economic factors - and make sure our causality analysis was actually meaningful, not just correlation dressed up as insight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The website integration was where everything came together. We built an interactive interface that let users explore the data themselves, compare countries, and understand the complex web of factors that influence women's political participation.
    </p>

    <h2>The Reality Check</h2>
    <p>
      We advanced to the final round among 24 teams and took home a consolation prize, but honestly? The real win was building something that people could actually use. LegisLadies.com became a tool for data-driven discussions about political representation - exactly what we hoped for.
    </p>
    <p>
      This wasn't just a hackathon project; it was about using AI responsibly to tackle real social issues. We proved that ethical AI isn't just about avoiding harm - it's about actively working toward a more equitable world.
